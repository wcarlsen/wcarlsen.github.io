## Education

### MSc in Physics

##### Niels Bohr Institute University of Copenhagen (09 - 15)

An experiment trying, via optomechanical effects, to laser cool a nano-membrane to its ground state. The nano-membrane motion is caused by Brownian motion due to its finite temperature. It is exactly this vibrational noise we cooled away to glance at a macroscopic objects quantum behavior. The membrane was laser cooled from cryogenic temperature (4 K) down to 3 mK, yielding a 4% chance of observing the object in its ground state.
