## Resume

I (Willi Carlsen) am 37 years old and work as a Senior Cloud Engineer at Veo Technologies, a company that strives to make sports technology available to the masses. I consider myself an AWS and Kubernetes expert, and I have spent the last ~3 years building multiple highly scalable Kubernetes clusters for video processing, running more than 2000 nodes at peak. Before that I used ~4 years supporting digital transformation at DFDS building a developer platform utilizing AWS, Kubernetes and Kafka.

## Experience

### Cloud Engineer

##### DFDS (Aug 25 - present)

Too early to say...

### Senior Cloud Engineer

##### Veo Technologies (Aug 22 - Jul 25)

Building highly scalable Kubernetes clusters supporting video processing in AWS.

### Site Reliability Engineer

##### DFDS (May 19 - Aug 22)

Supporting digital transformation towards composable architecture and faster time to market via a developer platform utilizing AWS, Kubernetes and Kafka. The majority of the projects are open source on Github [https://github.com/DFDS](https://github.com/DFDS), go check them out.

### Data Engineer

##### DFDS (Jul 18 - Apr 19)

Helped lowering technical debt by transforming PoC's into production ready maintainable solutions, handling and creating data pipelines, Cloud solution deployment, web development, introducing some of software developments best practices into the area of data science, reducing complexity, risks and future need for maintenance.

### Growth Hacker/Data scientist

##### SimpleSite (Feb 16 - Jun 18)

Data crunching, web development and implementing and evaluating A/B testing at a large scale.

## Education

### MSc in Physics

##### Niels Bohr Institute University of Copenhagen (09 - 15)

An experiment trying, via optomechanical effects, to laser cool a nano-membrane to its ground state. The nano-membrane motion is caused by Brownian motion due to its finite temperature. It is exactly this vibrational noise we cooled away to glance at a macroscopic objects quantum behavior. The membrane was laser cooled from cryogenic temperature (4 K) down to 3 mK, yielding a 4% chance of observing the object in its ground state.
